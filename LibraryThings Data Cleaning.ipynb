But this isn't always the case, as people get wrongly flagged. The website uses an appeal/counter-flag system. Abuse includes copy-pasting reviews from other sources.\n",

       "'I decided to read this book, because the topic is unusual and I was intrigued by the Renaissance era. The backdrop for this book is a convent in the late 1500s. This is excellent well-researched Historical Fiction with great insight into convent life during this time period. Its fascinating and disturbing to realize that at one time women were forced into the convent because their families had only enough money for one dowry or they were disfigured or simply not pretty enough. In this story, Serafina enters the convent against her will because she refuses to marry the man he father chooses for her. Shes young, rebellious and determined to escape, which adds a layer of mystery to the story as you wonder if she will succeed. On a deeper level this book explores the hierarchy of female leadership in a closed all female society.\\nReview previously posted at: www.princetonbookreview.com\\nFind us on Face book http://www.facebook.com/#%21/pages/Princeton-Book-Review/73532562757 '"

       "'Morozovs excellent first book, The Net Delusion, established him as a major critic of internet eschatology, particularly the utopian brand. His latest book attempts to expand on that critique, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. (Insert joke about sophomore efforts and snark here.) For a sample mostly taken from the book, heres Morozov on why we shouldnt be sanguine about using technology to improve incarceration. A good sampling of Morozovs work is available online; I would recommend avoiding his debate with Farhad Manjoo in Slate, where Morozov mostly ignores legitimate hits (he attacks generalizations like the internet but himself has no trouble criticizing Silicon Valley) in favor of snide near-ad hominems.\\nMorozov wouldnt be surprised that I, as an internet reviewer (ordinary people dont write reviews for the same reasons as professional critics; they are mostly interested in reviewing their own experience, not in making sense of a given work), cant improve on Kevin Driscolls take in the LA Review of Books, which has some very smart things to say about Morozovs critiques of solutionism (social issues as problems with a fixed solution rather than approaches that have to be negotiated and compromised on) and internet-centrism. [Side note on that Internet reviewer thing--there\\'s a very interesting piece to be written here bringing in Janice Radway\\'s Reading the Romance and a discussion of what \"making sense of a given work\" might mean.] For a rather harsher view, theres Tim Wu, who is attacked in the book and understandably annoyed; his criticisms are not unwarranted. \\nMorozov is a skeptic not just of whether Silicon Valleys big promises can be carried out but, more importantly, whether they should be. Friction, lack of transparency, inefficiency, and so on are not just hinderers of efficiency, but crucial parts of human self-definition and autonomy; politics isnt politics if its not messy and a bit hypocritical. Compromises and imperfections can be good, not bad; politics cant be improved the same way that market transactions can beif all interactions could be win-win, we wouldnt have politics. Try telling [an Amazon] shopper that not all of his or her desires can be satisfied because someone else has equally compelling interests and those have to be taken into account as well; the market simply doesnt work that way. And the consumerist mentality that solutionists bring to political challenges leads to disappointment and disgust with politics, when it should lead to a rejection of solutionism: Most public institutions should not be held to the same standards as their private counterparts because their mission is to provide goods and services that markets cannot or should not provide. More generally, inefficiencies, hypocrisies, and the existence of crime might be problematic in some limited sense, but they do not necessarily add up to a problem worth solvingany more than having a soccer match that lasts for ninety minutes rather than an eternity and features twenty-two people instead of everyone at the stadium is a problem to be solved.\\nRelatedly, the frictionless solutions promoted by techno-utopians often dont solve the problems they purport to, and they dont solve them in particular ways reflecting existing political and social inequalities. For example, biometric identification technologies turn out to have particular trouble with certain racial groups, and fingerprint scanners have difficulty with people in certain working-class occupations--not that this is anything new, as Morozov is at pains to point out. (See also the way in which visual communications technology is bound up in whiteness: Richard Dyer, \"Making \\'White\\' People White, in The Social Shaping of Technology, eds. Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman (noting that, among other things, videotape quality was evaluated by how well it displayed a blank, pale orange signal called \"skin\" that was supposed to match white skin); Brian Winston, A Whole Technology of Dyeing: A Note on Ideology and the Apparatus of the Chromatic Moving Image, Daedalus, Vol. 114, No. 4, The Moving Image (Fall, 1985), pp. 105-123 (discussing how, at every stage, film development was guided by how it did at showing white skin).)\\nFor another example, massive online open courses, Morozov, as many others have done, points out that what they offer isnt individual contact with an expert (even a grad student) but rather something else, and they dont exist in a political vacuum: In promising almost immediate and much cheaper results, they can easily undermine support for more ambitious, more intellectually stimulating, but also more demanding reform projects. Algorithms to recommend books to you have their biases, but thats nothing compared to the dangers of algorithms that predict crime based on current circumstances (including poverty and racism that mean that crimes are committed and detected in particular ways). And design that simply prevents the possibility of crime also often prevents the possibility of civil disobedience, an important driver of social change: Sometimes being caught with marijuana in ones pocket is better than being prevented from putting it there, simply because an arrest is likely to generate media attention and trigger a public debate about drug laws. But hes always context-sensitive, and not dismissive of all better living through technologyanti-drunk-driving technology might be a good idea even if other technological interventions arent.\\nI was reminded of Morozovs critique of big data solutionism by this bit in Slate about how facts can change their meanings when you have more context:\\n Marti Barletta, a consultant in marketing to women, told me one of the reasons women have gained a reputation for caring about frivolous details is because they do so much research. By the time they arrive at dealerships, theyve already logged countless hours online finding cars that satisfy their main criteria. Now, theyre picking through minutiaewhat, precisely, makes the Nissan Maxima better than the Toyota Camry? (Could it be the number of cup holders?) These questions, Barletta says, contribute to an impression among salesmen that women care mostly about the little stuff.\\nThis is a good example of the point that data-driven solutions cant ever be entirely data-driven: you always need a theory.\\nMorozov also constantly emphasizes that people construct technologies. Theres nothing inevitable about the configuration of the internet, or Facebook or Google for that matter. Facebook could limit the number of ads it shows; Google could write different algorithms. As Tarleton Gillespie insightfully noted, Twitters algorithm for picking trending topics favors breadth (many groups using the same hashtag) over depth (a united group using the hashtag a lot), which is a political design choice that can be contested. When we focus on current numbers, such as monitoring how much water we consume, we may be motivated to take individual action but we dont understand or consider the complex systems of overall water consumption, and we arent challenged to think of how we might get a different set of numbersMorozov wants our technologies to confound and challenge us.\\nThis is an important reminder, but it leads Morozov to be highly critical of activist discourses around things like SOPA/PIPA/ACTAs dont break the internet advocacy, and here (like many of his reviewers) I think he somewhat misses the mark. Very few of the leaders, and I suspect very few of the followers, of the anti-SOPA/PIPA/ACTA protests believed that http and IP addresses and the like would disappear under SOPA/PIPA/ACTA etc. Rather, they believed that key features of the internet they knew and liked would be hampered if not destroyed. The internet that existed, they thought, would be similar to the Medicare that would exist if what we now call Medicare were replaced by a voucher system. Its fair game in such a debate to say that Medicare would be destroyed by such a change; its even fair game to say that marriage would be destroyed by extending it to women who want to marry women, even if thats a dumb argument on its own merits. Yes, of course we should often question definitions, where much of the important rhetorical work is getting done, and Morozov is right to point that outbut many of the people he accuses really do know that already, and have made it pretty clear that they do.\\n(Hes particularly unfair, it seems to me, to Jonathan Zittrain, whose The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It comes under attack for internet-centrism and quixotic desire to keep the internet in a single state forever. E.g, Morozov says to claim that Appleone of Zittrains culpritsis bad for innovation because its bad for the Internet is like claiming that the Internet is bad for innovation because its bad for the telephone. Well, it might have been bad for the telephonebut when did preservation of the telephone become a lofty social goal? Yet a significant chunk of Zittrains book is devoted precisely to addressing questions of when we can say a technological configuration/change in the direction of greater or lesser centralized control is a good thing. Zittrain isnt entirely successful, I think, but by failing to acknowledge his explicit attempts to grapple with Morozovs points, Morozov makes it seem as if Zittrain were silly or hypocritical, and himself ends up fighting a straw man. This ungenerosity isnt unique in the book. Later, for example, Morozov suggests that those who favor market transactions trading private data for material benefits as mutually beneficial must also therefore approve torture provided the prisoners strike the right deal and are well compensated, whatever that might mean.)\\nMorozov is at his best discussing tradeoffs and political reactions to technology: greater access to information can be manipulated by governments just like other new forms of power can be, and ifwhich is not yet establishedthere is a link between the two, hes right that its not clear that the local politics in Baha Blanca [Argentina] [should] make sacrifices so that a fifteen-year-old in Palo Alto can remix cat videos without going to jail. He doesnt want that fifteen-year-old to go to jail, but he also doesnt want arguments for that remixers protection to prevent any tinkering with technologies to make them safer, for some politically chosen definition of safer, especially since private parties and nondemocratic states are willing to tinker anyway.\\nSome have found his attack on extreme self-monitoring technologies and technologists, who are really outliers, to be a bit much, but I really liked his point (again, not new, but well made) that there is a deep political problem with proposing self-monitoring as the solution to the barrage of advertising and subsidies that keep us eating terrible, unhealthy food: yes, some of us might find ingenious engineering solutions to resist insidious marketing, but in all this celebration of modern technology, shouldnt we also do something about the marketing itself? . [P]olitical action all but disappears; rather than reforming the system, we just tinker with ourselves and tend to our reservoirs of willpower the way Swiss bankers tend to their vaults. But Morozov also hates nudging via technical or legal structures, even though thats pretty much the opposite of the individualistic solutions he condemns, because he wants us all to think deeply, and exhaustingly, about all our politically relevant choices, which is to say basically all of them, though he talks most about energy consumption.\\nProbably Morozovs most effective assault is on the concept of openness as an unqualified good. Because of preexisting political struggles, open data will be used in politically inflected waysfor example, maps that visualize crime statistics across different neighborhoods could help improve police effectiveness, but they could also devalue properties and make people living in dodgy neighborhoods to be less willing to report crimes. Openness has feedback effects. Likewise, digitization of land records in India, in an attempt to empower the weak, may have benefited the rich and powerful by exposing which occupants lacked formal title despite being morally and even legally owners. Morozov advocates for context-specific solutionshere, accepting other methods of proving title such as old family photos or maps along with official land titles, or selectively limiting access to land records so that people with no obvious need to see them cant do so. Information, he argues, should be collected and distributed in full awareness of the social and cultural complexity of the institutional environment in which it is gathered. Sometimes preserving the social relations that enable that environment to exist  might require producing data that is only half transparent or half accessible . [D]emocracy thrives on compromise and the art of reconciling seemingly irreconcilable interests. And its hard to disagree with that last point, whatever excesses are in the rest of the book. '"

       "'When we meet Bud Caldwell, he is living in an orphanage in Flint, Michigan. Soon, though, we find him on the lam and in search of his father whom he has never met. He always carries his few belongings in a suitcase, and in the suitcase are clues his dead mother left behind about his father. This hope of escaping the abuses of foster care and orphan life propels him onward as he searches for his long lost, unknown father. The story is set during the Great Depression, at a time when little black boys are not permitted where \"white folks\" are permitted. The story bridges the gaps in cultural differences by using the authentic voice of a typical young boy who is struggling to be grown but is still a frightened young man. In the story he has gone through so much and yet keeps his cynical sense of humor about him.\\nI think this book is an excellent multicultural read for persons of all ages. The ISSUES are not overstated and do not take from the story. Many young readers will feel smarter than Bud as they may be older and more experienced about life than Bud is presented in the story. This book is excellent for its historical value for children as there are hints throughout that paint a picture of what life was like in the time that Bud was traveling...
